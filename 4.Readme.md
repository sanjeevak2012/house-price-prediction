### why there are lot of zeos what sense it would make ?
The presence of many zeros, especially followed by a few ones, in your input data (like `0.0, 0.0, 0.0, ..., 1.0, 0.0, 0.0`) is a strong indicator that your data has undergone a common preprocessing technique called **One-Hot Encoding**.

### What is One-Hot Encoding?

In your original dataset, you have many **categorical features**. These are features that represent categories or labels, not numerical quantities.

Examples from your data:
* `MSZoning` (e.g., 'RL', 'RM', 'FV')
* `Street` (e.g., 'Pave', 'Grvl')
* `Neighborhood` (e.g., 'CollgCr', 'Veenker')
* `HouseStyle` (e.g., '1Story', '2Story')
* `RoofStyle`, `Exterior1st`, `Foundation`, `HeatingQC`, etc.

Machine learning algorithms (especially linear models and many tree-based models like XGBoost) generally work best with numerical input. They don't understand text categories directly.

**One-Hot Encoding** is a technique to convert these categorical variables into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can use. Here's how it works:

1.  **For each unique category** within a categorical feature, a **new binary (0 or 1) column** is created.
2.  For a given data point (a house), if that data point belongs to a specific category, the corresponding new column will have a `1`, and all other new columns for that original feature will have a `0`.

### Example: `MSZoning`

Let's say your `MSZoning` column has categories like: 'RL', 'RM', 'FV', 'C (all)', 'A (agr)'.

After one-hot encoding, instead of one `MSZoning` column, you'd get five new columns:

| Original MSZoning | MSZoning_RL | MSZoning_RM | MSZoning_FV | MSZoning_C (all) | MSZoning_A (agr) |
| :---------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| RL                | 1           | 0           | 0           | 0                | 0                |
| RM                | 0           | 1           | 0           | 0                | 0                |
| FV                | 0           | 0           | 1           | 0                | 0                |

### Why lots of zeros?

* **Many Categories:** If you have a feature like `Neighborhood` with 25 different neighborhoods, one-hot encoding will create 25 new columns for just that one feature. For any single house, only one of those 25 columns will be `1`, and the other 24 will be `0`.
* **Multiple Categorical Features:** When you apply this across *all* your categorical features (and you have many, like `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `LotShape`, `LandContour`, `Utilities`, `LotConfig`, `LandSlope`, `Neighborhood`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `RoofMatl`, `Exterior1st`, `Exterior2nd`, `MasVnrType`, `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `Foundation`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `BsmtExposure`, `BsmtFinType1`, `BsmtFinType2`, `Heating`, `HeatingQC`, `CentralAir`, `Electrical`, `KitchenQual`, `Functional`, `FireplaceQu`, `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PavedDrive`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`, `MiscFeature`, `SaleType`, `SaleCondition`), the total number of columns in your dataset can explode. Your original 80-ish features might turn into several hundred features after one-hot encoding.
* **Sparse Data:** Since each house only belongs to one category for each original feature, most of these newly created binary columns will contain zeros for any given row. This leads to what's known as **sparse data**, meaning most of the values are zero.

**In summary:**

The many zeros and scattered ones in your input JSON make perfect sense if your categorical features were converted using **One-Hot Encoding**. It's a standard and necessary step to prepare such data for most machine learning algorithms. The few `1.0` values represent the specific categories that apply to that particular house for its various categorical attributes.

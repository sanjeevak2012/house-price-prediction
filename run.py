)

# * When you run `python run.py`, MLflow:

# 1. Reads `MLproject` in the same directory.
# 2. Finds the `Training` entry point (which is `python train.py`).
# 3. Spins up a Conda environment defined by `conda.yaml`.
# 4. Executes `train.py` under the “ElasticNet” experiment, logging everything to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
